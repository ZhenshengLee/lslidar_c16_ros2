# autoware auto based lslidar_c16 driver

If you want the original ros2 lslidar_c16 driver, please go to the official repo [foxy branch of lslidar_c16](https://github.com/ZhenshengLee/lslidar_c16/tree/foxy)

If you want the safty-critial version of lidar driver, I recommend this repo for lslidar_c16.

The methodology of this repo is based on [building-safe-algorithms-in-the-open](https://www.apex.ai/post/building-safe-algorithms-in-the-open-part-1-design)

Thanks to [APEX.AI](https://www.apex.ai/) for guidline and works with velodyne, and [andreaslebherz](https://github.com/andreaslebherz/ouster_ros2) for early works with ouster.
